# Astronomy Quiz

A project which my friend and I made. Using Flutter framework to develop, Astronomy Quiz contains 6 topics related to astronomy, each with 15 questions that will be randomised each time you take the quiz. 

To install, just download the APK and run the APK file on your phone. After that, you can enter the app just like the other.
